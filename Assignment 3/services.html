                        <h1>Extreme Poverty:</h1>
                        <p> One of the most consistent themes throughout Scripture is the idea that we are called to help
                             the poor, uplift the oppressed, and show compassion for those in need. 
                             This is the basis for all we do at Food For The Poor, 
                             and the reason why we work to alleviate extreme poverty.

                        </p>

                        <h1>Unsafe Housing:</h1>
                        <p>
                            we are helping for Millions of poor families who are living in hazardous housing conditions, 
                            with no running water, electricity or even so much as a locking front door. Instead of a solid, 
                            safe home where children can peacefully sleep, they live in crudely pieced together huts made from mud, sticks, 
                            tin, tarp, cardboard and whatever other discarded materials they can find.
                           
                        </p>

                        <h1>Orphaned or Abandoned Children:</h1>
                        <p>
                        
                            millions of orphaned, abandoned or neglected children that they don't have a safe place 
                            to call home. So many precious little ones are trying to survive day to day
                            unprotected from abuse, hunger, violence and sickness. We are on a mission to rescue and protect these vulnerable children.
