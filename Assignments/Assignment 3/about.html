                <p>Food For The Poor is God's instrument to help the materially poor and to renew the poor in spirit.

                    Our ministry is a reflection of our Lord's unconditional love - a love that surrenders all, 
                    that inspires trust and faith, and that embraces all people, regardless of race, status or creed.</p>

                <p>
                    Our mission is to bring relief to the poorest of the poor in the countries where we serve.

                    We strive to reflect God's unconditional love. It's a sacrificial love that embraces all people 
                    regardless of race or religion.
                    We pray that by God's grace, and with your support, 
                    we can continue to bring relief to the suffering and hope to the hopeless.
                </p>

                            We help families in need by providing food, housing, emergency relief and much more.
                            we are called to help the poor, uplift the oppressed, and show compassion for those in need. 
                            This is the basis for all we do at Food For The Poor, and the reason why we work to alleviate extreme poverty.
